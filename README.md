# PyOpenGL 3D Shapes

This project demonstrates the rendering of basic 3D shapes using PyOpenGL and Pygame in Python. The shapes include a cube, a triangular prism, and a pyramid.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- PyOpenGL

You can install the required packages using pip:
''pip install pygame PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate''


### Running the Application

To run the application, execute the main script for each shape:

- For the cube:
''python Cube.py''


- For the triangular prism:
''python Prism.py''


- For the pyramid:
''python Pyramid.py''


## Controls

The shapes can be manipulated using the following keyboard controls:

### Translation
- Move left: `A`
- Move right: `D`
- Move up: `W`
- Move down: `S`
- Move closer: `Q`
- Move away: `E`

- **Rotation**:
- Rotate around the x-axis (counter-clockwise): `U`
- Rotate around the x-axis (clockwise): `J`
- Rotate around the y-axis (counter-clockwise): `I`
- Rotate around the y-axis (clockwise): `K`
- Rotate around the z-axis (counter-clockwise): `O`
- Rotate around the z-axis (clockwise): `L`

- **Scaling**:
- Scale down uniformly: `Z`
- Scale up uniformly: `X`

- **Model Switching** (for the main application):
- Switch between models: `Spacebar`
